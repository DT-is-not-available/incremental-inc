# IDEAS FOR INCREMENTAL INC.
is this a real boy? who knows.
maybe its just a fake wooden puppet, but on the off
chance something magical occurs heres the Big Ol' Listâ„¢
- [x] Rename autoclicker to generator
- [x] Replicator - click when the value is up, not when down
    - [x] Overclock (bigger value)
    - [x] 2nd wave
    - [x] >dangerous overclock (bigger value)
    - [x] 3rd wave (7.5 mil)
    - [x] *Momentum - the more you click the better results at risk of overheat timeout & loss
- [x] Farms, multiple plots with timed growing and events
    - [x] 12 plots
    - [x] 3s and 4s
    - [x] >greenhouse - grow time x2.5 (2 mil)
    - [x] 5s 6s and 7s (5 mil)
    - [x] 24 plots (10 mil)
    - [ ] *Crop overgrowing - grow another digit at risk of crop death & loss
- [ ] Particle Simulator - try to get particles to collide 
to get points, particles cost points
- [ ] "Mystery Box" - open a box at an exponential cost,
gives you random items you can either sell or craft into
something to sell
- [ ] bit flipper "Deviation Correction"- random set of bits you have to correct (basically whack-a-mole)
- [ ] "Help Wanted Sign" employees - automate parts of tasks which can reduce loss
    - gotta pay them, no free labor here 
- [ ] once you get employees you start getting stuff that
  need constant management or you will lose score

- [ ] 64-512 bit computing
- [ ] farm max possible plots = 24
- [ ] farm max yield = 1-9
- [ ] farm overgrowing

## ideas for "plot" points
- [ ] replacing employees with robots which are more efficient, employees get mad, deal with that
- [ ] something about killing the numbers god to gain a stupidly high increment buff
  - killing "the hand" which removes need for any manual activity
