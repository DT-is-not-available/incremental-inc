# Warning!
Over the next few days I will continue to change things with how the game works under the hood. I will try to preserve any current save files, however breaking is bound to happen. Given this game is still in it's prototype stage, expect these types of changes to happen! I can't guarentee everything will continue to work all the time at the moment.

Happy incrementing!
