Lets get the bad news out of the way:
# The bad news
Any innovation purchases you have made in v0.2.12 or before have been forgotten by the game due to innovations getting a major overhaul. There isn't really a way to recover this right now, so either reset or feel free to abuse the fact that you can buy five hands twice.
# Back to the regularly scheduled update changelog
- Innovations have been reworked
- Fixed four hands being purchasable before two hands
- Fixed crop stems being larger than they should
- Made the one achievement in the game harder to get, and made it's description reveal itself under a condition
- Added debt (you wont run into it now but its worth mentioning that it's possible)
- Added one achievement

---
The good news is that this should be the worst breaking change to happen to this game, from here on out (I can't promise anything but) it should be smooth sailing.

---
Happy incrementing!
